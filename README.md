This is a python-based project where you can provide some text or a link and it will convert it into a QR code in image format. Once the image has been generated, you can see it in the files section and view/download it from there.

# Instructions:
This is fairly straightforward to use. Just follow the onscreen instructions and enter the link/text you want the QR code to direct to and enter your preferred filename when prompted. Make sure you remember to press the 'ENTER' key after you type into the console, for your input to be submitted and the next part of the program to run.

# What is a QR Code?
A QR code stands for 'Quick Response' code. It is a machine-readable code which is formed when squares (in most cases black) are arranged in a matrix. They are really useful because they can hold data, such as text, URLs, contacts, payment addresses, and much more!
